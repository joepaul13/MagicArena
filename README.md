# My Game Simulation

This is a simple game simulation where two players battle each other. Players have attributes like health, attack strength, and dice roll for damage.

## Running the Code:

**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/en.

**Clone or Download the Repository**: Clone this repository using Git or download the zip file.

**Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

`npm install`
This installs any required third-party libraries used in the project.

**Run the Tests (Optional)**: If you have unit tests written in a separate file (e.g., test.js), you can run them to verify the code's functionality:

`node test.js`
A message like "All tests passed!" indicates successful tests.

**Run the Simulation**: To run the actual game simulation (assuming the main script is in a file named main.js), execute:

`node main.js`
This should run the simulation and potentially print results to the console.
